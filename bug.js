This error occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The problem is that the `Linking.addEventListener` function doesn't always fire consistently, especially on Android.  Sometimes, the event listener is never triggered, and the app doesn't react to the deep link.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and a poor user experience.

Here's an example of the problematic code:

```javascript
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';

Linking.addEventListener('url', (event) => {
  console.log('Received URL:', event.url);
  // Process the URL here
});

Linking.getInitialURL().then(url => {
  if (url) {
    console.log('Initial URL:', url);
    // Process initial URL
  }
});
```
